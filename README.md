# Who's really telling the truth?

###  About
It's the election season and everyone is talking politics.
However, if youre like me and dont know much about politics
how are you supposed to know which canditate to root for?
Don't people say politicians lie? Who are you supposed to trust?
With a little bit of a easy web scraping and data analysis,
we are going to build a lie detector that can tell us.

### Files 

`Scrape.py`: The file does all the scraping and writes the data to a json

`process.py`: This file reads the json from disk and prepares it for analysis.

`Analysis.ipynb`: This file contains the actual detector
